# The Monad Challenges

The goal of this project is to provide a roadmap for hands-on exploration and
experimentation with monads. It is still rough and there is a fair amount
content that could be added.

## Contribution Guide

The site is a static site generated with
[Hakyll](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hakyll). To make edits to the text
or to add new sets/exercises, you should edit the markdown files in
[hakyll/pages](https://github.com/mightybyte/monad-challenges/tree/gh-pages/hakyll/pages).
The hakyll site generator is defined in the cabal file.  After you build it,
make sure the regen.sh script points to the correct location and run the
script.

If you want to contribute, but don't know what to do, check out the [open
issues](https://github.com/mightybyte/monad-challenges/issues) and see if you
can help with anything there.
